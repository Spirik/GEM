  GEMAppearance - struct for storing visual settings of GEM library.

  GEM (a.k.a. Good Enough Menu) - Arduino library for creation of graphic multi-level menu with
  editable menu items, such as variables (supports int, byte, float, double, bool, char[17] data types)
  and option selects. User-defined callback function can be specified to invoke when menu item is saved.

  Supports buttons that can invoke user-defined actions and create action-specific
  context, which can have its own enter (setup) and exit callbacks as well as loop function.

  Supports:
  - AltSerialGraphicLCD library by Jon Green (http://www.jasspa.com/serialGLCD.html);
  - U8g2 library by olikraus (https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_Arduino);
  - Adafruit GFX library by Adafruit (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library).
