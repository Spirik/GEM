  GEMPage - menu page (or level) for GEM library. Consists of a list of menu items.

  GEM (a.k.a. Good Enough Menu) - Arduino library for creation of graphic multi-level menu with
  editable menu items, such as variables (supports int, byte, boolean, char[17] data types) and
  option selects. User-defined callback function can be specified to invoke when menu item is saved.
  
  Supports buttons that can invoke user-defined actions and create action-specific
  context, which can have its own enter (setup) and exit callbacks as well as loop function.

  Requires AltSerialGraphicLCD library by Jon Green (http://www.jasspa.com/serialGLCD.html).
  LCD screen must be equipped with SparkFun Graphic LCD Serial Backpack and properly set up
  to operate using firmware provided with aforementioned library.
