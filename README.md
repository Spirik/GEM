===========

GEM (a.k.a. *Good Enough Menu*) - Arduino library for creation of graphic multi-level menu with editable menu items, such as variables (supports `int`, `byte`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`, `char[17]` data types) and option selects. User-defined callback function can be specified to invoke when menu item is saved.
  
Supports buttons that can invoke user-defined actions and create action-specific context, which can have its own enter (setup) and exit callbacks as well as loop function.

</p>

Supports [AltSerialGraphicLCD](http://www.jasspa.com/serialGLCD.html) (since GEM ver. 1.0), [U8g2](https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_Arduino) (since GEM ver. 1.1) and [Adafruit GFX](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library) (since GEM ver. 1.3) graphics libraries.

> Note that each of AltSerialGraphicLCD, U8g2 and Adafruit GFX libraries are required by default, regardless of which one of them is actually used to drive display (although the one that is not used won't affect compiled sketch size). However, it is possible (since GEM ver. 1.2.2) to exclude support for not used one. See [Configuration](#configuration) section for details.

> For use with AltSerialGraphicLCD library (by Jon Green) LCD screen must be equipped with [SparkFun Graphic LCD Serial Backpack](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9352) and properly set up to operate using firmware provided with aforementioned library.

> Cyrillic is partially supported in U8g2 version of GEM (since 1.1). Can be used in menu title, menu item labels (including variables, buttons, and menu page links), and select options. Editable strings with Cyrillic characters are not supported.

> Optional support for editable variables of `float` and `double` data types was added since version 1.2 of GEM. It is enabled by default, but can be disabled by editing [config.h](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/blob/master/src/config.h) file that ships with the library. Disabling this feature may save considerable amount of program storage space. See [Floating-point variables](#floating-point-variables) section for details.

When to use
-----------
If you want to equip your project with graphic LCD display and let user choose different options and settings to configure its operation. Whether it is control panel of smart home or simple configurable LED strip, GEM will provide all necessary controls for editing variables and navigating through submenus, as well as running user-defined functions.

Structure
-----------
Menu created with GEM library comprises of three base elements:

 - menu item (`GEMItem` class) - represents associated variable, button, or link to the next menu level (menu page);
 - menu page (`GEMPage` class) - consists of list of menu items and represents menu level;
 - menu object itself (`GEM`, or `GEM_u8g2`, or `GEM_adafruit_gfx` class) - can have multiple menu pages (linked to each other) with multiple menu items each.

![GEM structure](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki/images/gem-structure.png)

Installation
------------

Library format is compatible with Arduino IDE 1.5.x+. There are two ways to install the library:

- Download ZIP-archive directly from [Releases](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/releases) section (or Master branch) and extract it into GEM folder inside your Library folder.
- Using Library Manager (since Arduino IDE 1.6.2): navigate to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries` inside your Arduino IDE and search for GEM library, then click `Install`. (Alternatively you can add previously downloaded ZIP through `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library` menu).

Whichever option you choose you may need to reload IDE afterwards.

Each of [AltSerialGraphicLCD](http://www.jasspa.com/serialGLCD.html), [U8g2](https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_Arduino) and [Adafruit GFX](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library) libraries are required to be installed by default as well. However, it is possible (since GEM ver. 1.2.2) to exclude support for not used ones. See [Configuration](#configuration) section for details.

How to use with AltSerialGraphicLCD
-----------------------------------

<summary>Click here to view</summary>

### Requirements

GEM supports [AltSerialGraphicLCD](http://www.jasspa.com/serialGLCD.html) library. LCD screen must be equipped with [SparkFun Graphic LCD Serial Backpack](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9352) and properly set up to operate using firmware provided with AltSerialGraphicLCD. Installation and configuration of it is covered in great detail in AltSerialGraphicLCD manual.

In theory GEM is compatible with any display, that is supported by SparkFun Graphic LCD Serial Backpack. Guaranteed to work with [128x64](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/710) pixel displays. [160x128](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8799) pixel ones should work fine as well, although it wasn't tested.

### Import

To include AltSerialGraphicLCD-compatible version of GEM library add the following line at the top of your sketch:

```cpp
#include <GEM.h>
```

AltSerialGraphicLCD library will be included automatically through GEM library, so no need to include it explicitly in your sketch (although it still needs to be installed in your system, of course).

In order to communicate with your SparkFun Graphic LCD Serial Backpack, AltSerialGraphicLCD library uses [SoftwareSerial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SoftwareSerial) (that ships with Arduino IDE). There is no need to explicitly include it in your sketch as well, because it is already included through AltSerialGraphicLCD library. So the following line is completely optional (although note that second inclusion won't affect the size of you sketch) - you may omit it and use SoftwareSerial as though it was included.

```cpp
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
```
> Note that it is possible to use hardware serial instead (e.g. if you're planning to use it with Arduino Leonardo's `Serial1` class), however some modifications of AltSerialGraphicLCD library would be required in that case.

One more additional library that may come in handy (although is not necessary) is [KeyDetector](https://github.com/Spirik/KeyDetector) - it is small and lightweight library for key press events detection. It is used in some of the supplied examples (as well as the following one) to detect button presses for navigation through menu. To include KeyDetector library, install it first and then add the following line:

```cpp
#include <KeyDetector.h>
```
### Use

Assume you have a simple setup as follows:

 - 128x64 LCD screen equipped with SparkFun Graphic LCD Serial Backpack, which is properly connected to the power source and to digital pins 8 and 9 of your Arduino for serial communication via SoftwareSerial library;
 - also you have 6 push-buttons (momentary switches) connected to the digital pins 2 to 7, wired with 10kOhm pulldown resistors (so the HIGH means that the button is pressed).

![Basic example breadboard](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki/images/ex_GEM_01_basic_bb_edited_1776_o.png)

Let's create a simple one page menu with one editable menu item associated with `int` variable, one with `boolean` variable, and a button, pressing of which will result in `int` variable value being printed to Serial monitor if `boolean` variable is set to `true`. To navigate through menu we will use 6 push-buttons connected to the Arduino (for four directional controls, one Cancel, and one Ok). For the sake of simplicity we will use KeyDetector library to detect single button presses (as we need a way to prevent continuously pressed button from triggering press event multiple times in a row).

> For more detailed examples and tutorials please visit GEM [wiki](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki).

#### Navigation buttons initial setup (via KeyDetector library)

Create constants for the pins you want to detect signals on (these are the pins the push-buttons are connected to):

```cpp
const byte downPin = 2;
const byte leftPin = 3;
const byte rightPin = 4;
const byte upPin = 5;
const byte cancelPin = 6;
const byte okPin = 7;
```

Create an array of `Key` objects. It will hold information about which button press event should be detected on which input pin:

```cpp
Key keys[] = {{GEM_KEY_UP, upPin}, {GEM_KEY_RIGHT, rightPin}, {GEM_KEY_DOWN, downPin}, {GEM_KEY_LEFT, leftPin}, {GEM_KEY_CANCEL, cancelPin}, {GEM_KEY_OK, okPin}};
```

> **Note:** aliases `GEM_KEY_UP`, `GEM_KEY_RIGHT`, `GEM_KEY_DOWN`, `GEM_KEY_LEFT`, `GEM_KEY_CANCEL`, and `GEM_KEY_OK` are predefined and come with the GEM library. They represent identifiers of buttons that menu listens and responds to. E.g. sending to menu `GEM_KEY_DOWN` will trigger it to move cursor down and highlight the next menu item, etc.

Create `KeyDetector` object called `myKeyDetector` and supply its constructor with `keys` array created at the previous step and explicitly pass the size of the array:

```cpp
KeyDetector myKeyDetector(keys, sizeof(keys)/sizeof(Key));
```

Navigation buttons initial setup is now complete.

#### LCD initial setup (via SoftwareSerial and AltSerialGraphicLCD libraries)

Create constants for the pins SparkFun Graphic LCD Serial Backpack is connected to:

```cpp
const byte rxPin = 8;
const byte txPin = 9;
```

Initialize an instance of the SoftwareSerial library called `serialLCD`:

```cpp
SoftwareSerial serialLCD(rxPin, txPin);
```

Create an instance of the `GLCD` class named `glcd`. This instance is used to call all the subsequent GLCD functions (internally from GEM library, or manually in your sketch if it is required). Instance is created with a reference to the software serial object:

```cpp
GLCD glcd(serialLCD);
```

LCD initial setup is now complete.

#### Menu initial setup

Create variables that you would like to be editable through the menu. Assign them initial values:

```cpp
int number = -512;
boolean enablePrint = false;
```

Create two menu item objects of class `GEMItem`, linked to `number` and `enablePrint` variables. Let's name them simply "Number" and "Enable print" respectively - these names will be printed on screen:

```cpp
GEMItem menuItemInt("Number:", number);
GEMItem menuItemBool("Enable print:", enablePrint);
```

Create menu button that will trigger `printData()` function. It will print value of our `number` variable to Serial monitor if `enablePrint` is `true`. We will write (define) this function later. However we should forward-declare it in order to pass its reference to `GEMItem` constructor. Let's name our button "Print":

```cpp
void printData(); // Forward declaration
GEMItem menuItemButton("Print", printData);
```

Create menu page object of class `GEMPage`. Menu page holds menu items (`GEMItem`) and, in fact, represents menu level. Menu can have multiple menu pages (linked to each other) with multiple menu items each. Let's call our only menu page "Main Menu":

```cpp
GEMPage menuPageMain("Main Menu");
```

And finally, create menu object of class `GEM`. Supply its constructor with a reference to `glcd` object we created earlier:

```cpp
GEM menu(glcd);
```

> **Note:** `GEM` constructor supports additional optional parameters that can customize look of the menu. See [Reference](#reference) and [wiki](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki) for details.

We will link menu items to menu pages to menu in `setup()` function. For now, menu initial setup is complete.

#### setup() function

In `setup()` function of the sketch define modes of the pins push-buttons are connected to:

```cpp
pinMode(downPin, INPUT);
pinMode(leftPin, INPUT);
pinMode(rightPin, INPUT);
pinMode(upPin, INPUT);
pinMode(cancelPin, INPUT);
pinMode(okPin, INPUT);
```

Init serial communications (both native `Serial` and software `serialLCD`):

```cpp
Serial.begin(115200);
serialLCD.begin(115200);
```

Reset LCD to its initial state. Using delays here is optional, but I've found that it actually may help certain LCDs to regain their initial state more effectively after being previously unexpectedly shut down. Adjust the delays to what best works for your display.

```cpp
delay(500);
glcd.reset();
delay(1000);
```

If you still encounter spontaneous freezing on load (especially right after sketch uploads), you may want to add the second instance of reset instructions. This (almost) bulletproof solution will ensure that screen boots and properly resets no matter what.

```cpp
// Uncomment the following lines in dire situations
// (e.g. when screen becomes unresponsive after shutdown)
glcd.reset();
delay(1000);
```

Init menu. That will run some initialization routines (e.g. load sprites into LCD Serial Backpack's internal memory), then show splash screen (which can be customized).

```cpp
menu.init();
```

The next step is to gather all of the previously declared menu items and pages together and assign them to our menu. It is convenient to do that in a separate function. Let's call it `setupMenu()`. We will define it later.

```cpp
setupMenu();
```

And finally, draw menu to the screen:

```cpp
menu.drawMenu();
```

`setup()` function of the sketch is now complete:

```cpp
void setup() {
  // Push-buttons pin modes
  pinMode(downPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(leftPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(rightPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(upPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(cancelPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(okPin, INPUT);

  // Serial communications setup
  Serial.begin(115200);
  SerialLCD.begin(115200);

  // LCD reset
  delay(500);
  glcd.reset();
  delay(1000);
  // Uncomment the following lines in dire situations
  // (e.g. when screen becomes unresponsive after shutdown)
  glcd.reset();
  delay(1000);

  // Menu init, setup and draw
  menu.init();
  setupMenu();
  menu.drawMenu();
}
```

#### setupMenu() function

Let's assemble our menu in `setupMenu()` function. First, add menu items to menu page:

```cpp
menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemInt);
menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemBool);
menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemButton);
```

Because we don't have multiple menu levels, all we left to do now is to add our only menu page to menu and set it as initial menu page (loaded when menu first drawn):

```cpp
menu.setMenuPageCurrent(menuPageMain);
```

`setupMenu()` function is now complete:

```cpp
void setupMenu() {
  // Add menu items to menu page
  menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemInt);
  menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemBool);
  menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemButton);

  // Add menu page to menu and set it as current
  menu.setMenuPageCurrent(menuPageMain);
}
```

#### loop() function

In the `loop()` function of the sketch we'll be listening to push-buttons presses (using `KeyDetector`) and delegate pressed button to menu: 

```cpp
void loop() {
  // If menu is ready to accept button press...
  if (menu.readyForKey()) {
    // ...detect key press using KeyDetector library
    myKeyDetector.detect();
    // Pass pressed button to menu
    // (pressed button ID is stored in trigger property of KeyDetector object)
    menu.registerKeyPress(myKeyDetector.trigger);
  }
}
```

#### Button action

Let's define `printData()` function that we declared earlier. It will be invoked each time the "Print" button in our menu is pressed.  It should print value of our `number` variable to Serial monitor if `enablePrint` is `true`.

```cpp
void printData() {
  // If enablePrint flag is set to true (checkbox on screen is checked)...
  if (enablePrint) {
    // ...print the number to Serial
    Serial.print("Number is: ");
    Serial.println(number);
  } else {
    Serial.println("Printing is disabled, sorry:(");
  }
}
```

> This is the simplest action that menu item button can have. More elaborate versions make use of custom "[context](#appcontext)" that can be created when button is pressed. In that case, button action can have its own setup and loop functions (named `context.enter()` and `context.loop()`) that run similarly to how sketch operates. It allows you to initialize variables and e.g. prepare screen (if needed for the task that function performs), and then run through loop function, waiting for user input, or sensor reading, or command to terminate and exit back to the menu eventually. In the latter case additional `context.exit()` function will be called, that can be used to clean up your context and e.g. to free some memory and draw menu back to screen.

#### Sketch

Full version of this basic example is shipped with the library and can be found at "examples/AltSerialGraphicLCD/Example-01_Basic/[Example-01_Basic.ino](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/blob/master/examples/AltSerialGraphicLCD/Example-01_Basic/Example-01_Basic.ino)".

#### Run

After compiling and uploading sketch to Arduino, wait while LCD screen boots and menu is being initialized and drawn to the screen. Then start pressing the push-buttons and navigate through the menu. Pressing "Ok" button (attached to pin 7) will trigger edit mode of the "Number" variable, or change state of "Enable print" option, or invoke action associated with "Print" menu button (depending on which menu item is currently selected). If "Enable print" option is checked, then pressing "Print" button will result in `number` variable printed to the Serial Monitor.

How to use with U8g2
--------------------

<details>
<summary>Click here to view</summary>

### Requirements

GEM supports [U8g2](https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_Arduino) library.

In theory GEM is compatible with any display, that is supported by U8g2 library (given that it is properly set up and configured using correct [constructor](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki/u8g2setupcpp)). Guaranteed to work with [128x64](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/710) pixel displays, based on KS0108 controller. [160x128](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8799) pixel ones should also work, as well as any other display that is supported by U8g2, although it is yet to be tested.

### Import

To include U8g2-compatible version of GEM library add the following line at the top of your sketch:

```cpp
#include <GEM_u8g2.h>
```

U8g2 library will be included automatically through GEM library, so no need to include it explicitly in your sketch (although it still needs to be installed in your system, of course).

### Use

Assume you have a simple setup as follows:

 - 128x64 LCD screen based on (or compatible with) KS0108 controller, connected as shown below, with 10kOhm potentiometer to adjust screen contrast;
 - also you have 6 push-buttons (momentary switches) connected to the digital pins 2 to 7, wired with 10kOhm pullup resistors (so the LOW means that the button is pressed).

![Basic example breadboard](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki/images/ex_GEM_01_basic_u8g2_breadboard_bb_edited_1974_o.png)

Let's create a simple one page menu with one editable menu item associated with `int` variable, one with `boolean` variable, and a button, pressing of which will result in `int` variable value being printed to Serial monitor if `boolean` variable is set to `true`. To navigate through menu we will use 6 push-buttons connected to the Arduino (for four directional controls, one Cancel, and one Ok). We will use U8g2 library to detect single button presses.

> For more detailed examples and tutorials please visit GEM [wiki](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki).

#### LCD initial setup (via U8g2 library)

U8g2 library supports numerous popular display controllers. Choose a matching constructor for the correct initialization of the display. See available constructors and supported controllers in the [documentation](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki/u8g2setupcpp) for U8g2 library.

In our case create an instance of the `U8G2_KS0108_128X64_1` class named `u8g2`. This instance is used to call all the subsequent U8g2 functions (internally from GEM library, or manually in your sketch if it is required).

```cpp
U8G2_KS0108_128X64_1 u8g2(U8G2_R0, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, /*enable=*/ A0, /*dc=*/ A1, /*cs0=*/ A3, /*cs1=*/ A2, /*cs2=*/ U8X8_PIN_NONE, /* reset=*/ U8X8_PIN_NONE);
```

> **Note:** GEM library is compatible with all [buffer size](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki/u8g2setupcpp#buffer-size) options (namely `_1`, `_2`, `_F`) and screen [rotation](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki/u8g2setupcpp#rotation) options supported by U8g2.

LCD initial setup is now complete.

#### Menu initial setup

Create variables that you would like to be editable through the menu. Assign them initial values:

```cpp
int number = -512;
boolean enablePrint = false;
```

Create two menu item objects of class `GEMItem`, linked to `number` and `enablePrint` variables. Let's name them simply "Number" and "Enable print" respectively - these names will be printed on screen:

```cpp
GEMItem menuItemInt("Number:", number);
GEMItem menuItemBool("Enable print:", enablePrint);
```

Create menu button that will trigger `printData()` function. It will print value of our `number` variable to Serial monitor if `enablePrint` is `true`. We will write (define) this function later. However we should forward-declare it in order to pass its reference to `GEMItem` constructor. Let's name our button "Print":

```cpp
void printData(); // Forward declaration
GEMItem menuItemButton("Print", printData);
```

Create menu page object of class `GEMPage`. Menu page holds menu items (`GEMItem`) and, in fact, represents menu level. Menu can have multiple menu pages (linked to each other) with multiple menu items each. Let's call our only menu page "Main Menu":

```cpp
GEMPage menuPageMain("Main Menu");
```

And finally, create menu object of class `GEM_u8g2`. Supply its constructor with a reference to `u8g2` object we created earlier:

```cpp
GEM_u8g2 menu(u8g2);
```

> **Note:** `GEM_u8g2` constructor supports additional optional parameters that can customize look of the menu. See [Reference](#reference) and [wiki](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki) for details.

We will link menu items to menu pages to menu in `setup()` function. For now, menu initial setup is complete.

#### setup() function

In `setup()` function of the sketch init serial communication:

```cpp
Serial.begin(115200);
```

Init `u8g2` instance of U8g2 library by calling `begin()` method and supplying it with pin numbers push-buttons are attached to:

```cpp
u8g2.begin(/*Select/OK=*/ 7, /*Right/Next=*/ 4, /*Left/Prev=*/ 3, /*Up=*/ 5, /*Down=*/ 2, /*Home/Cancel=*/ 6);
```

Init menu. That will run some initialization routines (e.g. clear display and apply some GEM specific settings), then show splash screen (which can be customized).

```cpp
menu.init();
```

The next step is to gather all of the previously declared menu items and pages together and assign them to our menu. It is convenient to do that in a separate function. Let's call it `setupMenu()`. We will define it later.

```cpp
setupMenu();
```

And finally, draw menu to the screen:

```cpp
menu.drawMenu();
```

`setup()` function of the sketch is now complete:

```cpp
void setup() {
  // Serial communication setup
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // U8g2 library init. Pass pin numbers the buttons are connected to.
  // The push-buttons should be wired with pullup resistors (so the LOW means that the button is pressed)
  u8g2.begin(/*Select/OK=*/ 7, /*Right/Next=*/ 4, /*Left/Prev=*/ 3, /*Up=*/ 5, /*Down=*/ 2, /*Home/Cancel=*/ 6);

  // Menu init, setup and draw
  menu.init();
  setupMenu();
  menu.drawMenu();
}
```

#### setupMenu() function

Let's assemble our menu in `setupMenu()` function. First, add menu items to menu page:

```cpp
menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemInt);
menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemBool);
menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemButton);
```

Because we don't have multiple menu levels, all we left to do now is to add our only menu page to menu and set it as initial menu page (loaded when menu first drawn):

```cpp
menu.setMenuPageCurrent(menuPageMain);
```

`setupMenu()` function is now complete:

```cpp
void setupMenu() {
  // Add menu items to menu page
  menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemInt);
  menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemBool);
  menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemButton);

  // Add menu page to menu and set it as current
  menu.setMenuPageCurrent(menuPageMain);
}
```

#### loop() function

In the `loop()` function of the sketch we'll be listening to push-buttons presses (using `U8g2`) and delegate pressed button to menu: 

```cpp
void loop() {
  // If menu is ready to accept button press...
  if (menu.readyForKey()) {
    // ...detect key press using U8g2 library
    // and pass pressed button to menu
    menu.registerKeyPress(u8g2.getMenuEvent());
  }
}
```

#### Button action

Let's define `printData()` function that we declared earlier. It will be invoked each time the "Print" button in our menu is pressed.  It should print value of our `number` variable to Serial monitor if `enablePrint` is `true`.

```cpp
void printData() {
  // If enablePrint flag is set to true (checkbox on screen is checked)...
  if (enablePrint) {
    // ...print the number to Serial
    Serial.print("Number is: ");
    Serial.println(number);
  } else {
    Serial.println("Printing is disabled, sorry:(");
  }
}
```

> This is the simplest action that menu item button can have. More elaborate versions make use of custom "[context](#appcontext)" that can be created when button is pressed.

How to use with Adafruit GFX
----------------------------

<details>
<summary>Click here to view</summary>

### Requirements

GEM supports [Adafruit GFX](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library) library.

In theory GEM is compatible with any display, that is supported by Adafruit GFX library (given that it is properly set up and configured as required by the library). Guaranteed to work with [Adafruit 1.8" 128x160](https://www.adafruit.com/products/358) TFT LCD display, based on ST7735 controller. Other ST77** based ones should also work, theoretically as well as any other display that is supported by Adafruit GFX, although it is yet to be tested.

### Import

To include Adafruit GFX-compatible version of GEM library add the following line at the top of your sketch:

```cpp
#include <GEM_adafruit_gfx.h>
```

Adafruit GFX library will be included automatically through GEM library, so no need to include it explicitly in your sketch (although it still needs to be installed in your system, of course).

However, in order to communicate with your display it is required to install and explicitly include library specific to controller of your display, e.g. ST7735:

```cpp
#include <Adafruit_ST7735.h>
```

One more additional library that may come in handy (although is not necessary) is [KeyDetector](https://github.com/Spirik/KeyDetector) - it is small and lightweight library for key press events detection. It is used in some of the supplied examples (as well as the following one) to detect button presses for navigation through menu. To include KeyDetector library, install it first and then add the following line:

```cpp
#include <KeyDetector.h>
```
### Use

Assume you have a simple setup as follows:

 - 128x160 TFT LCD display based on (or compatible with) ST7735 controller, e.g. [Adafruit 1.8" TFT Display with microSD](http://www.adafruit.com/products/358), connected as shown below;
 - also you have 6 push-buttons (momentary switches) connected to the digital pins 2 to 7, wired with 10kOhm pulldown resistors (so the HIGH means that the button is pressed).

![Basic example breadboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Spirik/GEM/images/ex_GEM_01_basic_agfx_breadboard_bb_edited_1590_o.png)

Let's create a simple one page menu with one editable menu item associated with `int` variable, one with `boolean` variable, and a button, pressing of which will result in `int` variable value being printed to Serial monitor if `boolean` variable is set to `true`. To navigate through menu we will use 6 push-buttons connected to the Arduino (for four directional controls, one Cancel, and one Ok). For the sake of simplicity we will use KeyDetector library to detect single button presses (as we need a way to prevent continuously pressed button from triggering press event multiple times in a row).

> For more detailed examples and tutorials please visit GEM [wiki](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki).

#### Navigation buttons initial setup (via KeyDetector library)

Create constants for the pins you want to detect signals on (these are the pins the push-buttons are connected to):

```cpp
const byte downPin = 2;
const byte leftPin = 3;
const byte rightPin = 4;
const byte upPin = 5;
const byte cancelPin = 6;
const byte okPin = 7;
```

Create an array of `Key` objects. It will hold information about which button press event should be detected on which input pin:

```cpp
Key keys[] = {{GEM_KEY_UP, upPin}, {GEM_KEY_RIGHT, rightPin}, {GEM_KEY_DOWN, downPin}, {GEM_KEY_LEFT, leftPin}, {GEM_KEY_CANCEL, cancelPin}, {GEM_KEY_OK, okPin}};
```

> **Note:** aliases `GEM_KEY_UP`, `GEM_KEY_RIGHT`, `GEM_KEY_DOWN`, `GEM_KEY_LEFT`, `GEM_KEY_CANCEL`, and `GEM_KEY_OK` are predefined and come with the GEM library. They represent identifiers of buttons that menu listens and responds to. E.g. sending to menu `GEM_KEY_DOWN` will trigger it to move cursor down and highlight the next menu item, etc.

Create `KeyDetector` object called `myKeyDetector` and supply its constructor with `keys` array created at the previous step and explicitly pass the size of the array:

```cpp
KeyDetector myKeyDetector(keys, sizeof(keys)/sizeof(Key));
```

Navigation buttons initial setup is now complete.

#### LCD initial setup (via Adafruit GFX library)

Adafruit GFX library supports several different display controllers (through separately installed and included libraries). Choose a matching library for the correct initialization of the display. See available libraries and supported controllers in the [documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library) for Adafruit GFX library.

In our case we included Adafruit_ST7735 library, and now we need to create an instance of the `Adafruit_ST7735` class named `tft`. This instance is used to call all the subsequent Adafruit GFX functions (internally from GEM library, or manually in your sketch if it is required). Before that, we define aliases for the pins display is connected to.

```cpp
#define TFT_CS    A2
#define TFT_RST   -1
#define TFT_DC    A3

Adafruit_ST7735 tft = Adafruit_ST7735(TFT_CS, TFT_DC, TFT_RST);
```

LCD initial setup is now complete.

#### Menu initial setup

Create variables that you would like to be editable through the menu. Assign them initial values:

```cpp
int number = -512;
boolean enablePrint = false;
```

Create two menu item objects of class `GEMItem`, linked to `number` and `enablePrint` variables. Let's name them simply "Number" and "Enable print" respectively - these names will be printed on screen:

```cpp
GEMItem menuItemInt("Number:", number);
GEMItem menuItemBool("Enable print:", enablePrint);
```

Create menu button that will trigger `printData()` function. It will print value of our `number` variable to Serial monitor if `enablePrint` is `true`. We will write (define) this function later. However we should forward-declare it in order to pass its reference to `GEMItem` constructor. Let's name our button "Print":

```cpp
void printData(); // Forward declaration
GEMItem menuItemButton("Print", printData);
```

Create menu page object of class `GEMPage`. Menu page holds menu items (`GEMItem`) and, in fact, represents menu level. Menu can have multiple menu pages (linked to each other) with multiple menu items each. Let's call our only menu page "Main Menu":

```cpp
GEMPage menuPageMain("Main Menu");
```

And finally, create menu object of class `GEM_adafruit_gfx`. Supply its constructor with a reference to `tft` object we created earlier:

```cpp
GEM_adafruit_gfx menu(tft, GEM_POINTER_ROW, GEM_ITEMS_COUNT_AUTO);
```

> **Note:** `GEM_POINTER_ROW` option defines the look of the menu item pointer, `GEM_ITEMS_COUNT_AUTO` turns on automatic calculation of number of items that will fit on the screen based on screen's height. `GEM_adafruit_gfx` constructor supports additional optional parameters that can customize look of the menu. See [Reference](#reference) and [wiki](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki) for details.

We will link menu items to menu pages to menu in `setup()` function. For now, menu initial setup is complete.

#### setup() function

In `setup()` function of the sketch define modes of the pins push-buttons are connected to:

```cpp
pinMode(downPin, INPUT);
pinMode(leftPin, INPUT);
pinMode(rightPin, INPUT);
pinMode(upPin, INPUT);
pinMode(cancelPin, INPUT);
pinMode(okPin, INPUT);
```

Init serial communications:

```cpp
Serial.begin(115200);
```

Init `tft` instance of Adafruit_ST7735/Adafruit GFX library by calling `initR()` method and supplying it with tab initialization parameter, suitable for your display (in case of Adafruit 1.8" TFT Display set it to `INITR_BLACKTAB`):

```cpp
tft.initR(INITR_BLACKTAB);
```

You can optionally [rotate](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/rotating-the-display) the display by calling `setRotation()` method, e.g.:

```cpp
tft.setRotation(3);
```

Init menu. That will run some initialization routines (e.g. load sprites into LCD Serial Backpack's internal memory), then show splash screen (which can be customized).

```cpp
menu.init();
```

The next step is to gather all of the previously declared menu items and pages together and assign them to our menu. It is convenient to do that in a separate function. Let's call it `setupMenu()`. We will define it later.

```cpp
setupMenu();
```

And finally, draw menu to the screen:

```cpp
menu.drawMenu();
```

`setup()` function of the sketch is now complete:

```cpp
void setup() {
  // Push-buttons pin modes
  pinMode(downPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(leftPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(rightPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(upPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(cancelPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(okPin, INPUT);

  // Serial communications setup
  Serial.begin(115200);

  // Use this initializer if using a 1.8" TFT screen:
  tft.initR(INITR_BLACKTAB);      // Init ST7735S chip, black tab
  // OR use this initializer if using a 1.8" TFT screen with offset such as WaveShare:
  // tft.initR(INITR_GREENTAB);   // Init ST7735S chip, green tab
  // See more options in Adafruit GFX library documentation

  // Optionally, rotate display
  // tft.setRotation(3); // See Adafruit GFX library documentation for details

  // Menu init, setup and draw
  menu.init();
  setupMenu();
  menu.drawMenu();
}
```

#### setupMenu() function

Let's assemble our menu in `setupMenu()` function. First, add menu items to menu page:

```cpp
menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemInt);
menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemBool);
menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemButton);
```

Because we don't have multiple menu levels, all we left to do now is to add our only menu page to menu and set it as initial menu page (loaded when menu first drawn):

```cpp
menu.setMenuPageCurrent(menuPageMain);
```

`setupMenu()` function is now complete:

```cpp
void setupMenu() {
  // Add menu items to menu page
  menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemInt);
  menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemBool);
  menuPageMain.addMenuItem(menuItemButton);

  // Add menu page to menu and set it as current
  menu.setMenuPageCurrent(menuPageMain);
}
```

#### loop() function

In the `loop()` function of the sketch we'll be listening to push-buttons presses (using `KeyDetector`) and delegate pressed button to menu: 

```cpp
void loop() {
  // If menu is ready to accept button press...
  if (menu.readyForKey()) {
    // ...detect key press using KeyDetector library
    myKeyDetector.detect();
    // Pass pressed button to menu
    // (pressed button ID is stored in trigger property of KeyDetector object)
    menu.registerKeyPress(myKeyDetector.trigger);
  }
}
```

#### Button action

Let's define `printData()` function that we declared earlier. It will be invoked each time the "Print" button in our menu is pressed.  It should print value of our `number` variable to Serial monitor if `enablePrint` is `true`.

```cpp
void printData() {
  // If enablePrint flag is set to true (checkbox on screen is checked)...
  if (enablePrint) {
    // ...print the number to Serial
    Serial.print("Number is: ");
    Serial.println(number);
  } else {
    Serial.println("Printing is disabled, sorry:(");
  }
}
```

> This is the simplest action that menu item button can have. More elaborate versions make use of custom "[context](#appcontext)" that can be created when button is pressed. In that case, button action can have its own setup and loop functions (named `context.enter()` and `context.loop()`) that run similarly to how sketch operates. It allows you to initialize variables and e.g. prepare screen (if needed for the task that function performs), and then run through loop function, waiting for user input, or sensor reading, or command to terminate and exit back to the menu eventually. In the latter case additional `context.exit()` function will be called, that can be used to clean up your context and e.g. to free some memory and draw menu back to screen.

#### Sketch

Full version of this basic example is shipped with the library and can be found at "examples/AdafruitGFX/Example-01_Basic/[Example-01_Basic.ino](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/blob/master/examples/AdafruitGFX/Example-01_Basic/Example-01_Basic.ino)".

#### Run

After compiling and uploading sketch to Arduino, wait while LCD screen boots and menu is being initialized and drawn to the screen. Then start pressing the push-buttons and navigate through the menu. Pressing "Ok" button (attached to pin 7) will trigger edit mode of the "Number" variable, or change state of "Enable print" option, or invoke action associated with "Print" menu button (depending on which menu item is currently selected). If "Enable print" option is checked, then pressing "Print" button will result in `number` variable printed to the Serial Monitor.

#### Methods

* **setSplash(** _const uint8_t PROGMEM_ *sprite **)**  `AltSerialGraphicLCD version`  
  *Accepts*: `_const uint8_t PROGMEM_ *`  
  *Returns*: nothing  
  Set custom sprite displayed as the splash screen when GEM is being initialized. Should be called before `GEM::init()`. The following is the format of the sprite as described in AltSerialGraphicLCD library documentation:
  > The sprite commences with two bytes which are the width and height of the image in pixels. The pixel data is organised as rows of 8 vertical pixels per byte where the least significant bit (LSB) is the top-left pixel and the most significant bit (MSB) tends towards the bottom-left pixel. A complete row of 8 vertical pixels across the image width comprises the first row, this is then followed by the next row of 8 vertical pixels and so on. Where the image height is not an exact multiple of 8 bits then any unused bits are typically set to zero (although this does not matter).

  For more details on splash customization see corresponding section of the [wiki](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki).

* **setSplash(** _byte_ width, _byte_ height, _const unsigned char U8X8_PROGMEM_ *image **)**  `U8g2 version`  
  *Accepts*: `byte`, `byte`, `_const unsigned char U8X8_PROGMEM_ *`  
  *Returns*: nothing  
  Set custom [XBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_BitMap) image displayed as the splash screen when GEM is being initialized. Should be called before `GEM_u8g2::init()`. For more details on splash customization and example refer to corresponding section of the [wiki](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki).

* **setSplash(** _byte_ width, _byte_ height, _const uint8_t PROGMEM_ *image **)**  `Adafruit GFX version`  
  *Accepts*: `byte`, `byte`, `_const uint8_t PROGMEM_ *`  
  *Returns*: nothing  
  Set custom bitmap image displayed as the splash screen when GEM is being initialized. The following is the format of the bitmap as described in Adafruit GFX library documentation:
  > A contiguous block of bits, where each `1` bit sets the corresponding pixel to 'color', while each `0` bit is skipped.

  Bitmap must be presented as a byte array and located in program memory using the PROGMEM directive, width and height of the bitmap must be supplied as a first and second argument to the function respectively. Should be called before `GEM_adafruit_gfx::init()`. See [Bitmaps](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/graphics-primitives#bitmaps-2002806-39) section of Adafruit GFX documentation for more details and [image2cpp](http://javl.github.io/image2cpp/) webtool for online bitmap conversion. For more details on splash customization and example refer to corresponding section of the [wiki](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki).

* **setSplashDelay(** _uint16_t_ value **)**  
  *Accepts*: `uint16_t`  
  *Returns*: nothing  
  Set splash screen delay (in ms). By default splash screen will be visible for 1000ms. Maximum supported value is 65535ms. Setting to 0 will disable splash screen. Should be called before `init()`.
  > **Note:** internally splash screen delay is implemented via `delay()` function. This is the only place in library where `delay()` is utilized (aside of example sketches).

* **hideVersion(** _boolean_ flag = true **)**  
  *Accepts*: `boolean`  
  *Returns*: nothing  
  Turn printing of the current GEM library version on splash screen off (`hideVersion()`) or back on (`hideVersion(false)`). By default the version is printed. Should be called before `init()`.

* **enableCyrillic(** _boolean_ flag = true **)**  `U8g2 version only`  
  *Accepts*: `boolean`  
  *Returns*: nothing  
  Turn Cyrillic typeset on (`enableCyrillic()`) or off (`enableCyrillic(false)`). [`u8g2_font_6x12_t_cyrillic`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/olikraus/u8g2/fntpic/u8g2_font_6x12_t_cyrillic.png) and [`u8g2_font_4x6_t_cyrillic`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/olikraus/u8g2/fntpic/u8g2_font_4x6_t_cyrillic.png) fonts from [U8g2](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2/wiki/fntlistall) will be used when Cyrillic typeset is enabled, and default fonts [`u8g2_font_6x12_tr`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/olikraus/u8g2/fntpic/u8g2_font_6x12_tr.png) and [`u8g2_font_tom_thumb_4x6_tr`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/olikraus/u8g2/fntpic/u8g2_font_tom_thumb_4x6_tr.png) will be used otherwise. You may use Cyrillic in menu title, menu item labels (`GEMItem`, including buttons and menu page links), and select options (`SelectOptionInt`, `SelectOptionByte`, `SelectOptionChar` data structures). Editable strings with Cyrillic characters are **not supported** (edit mode of such strings may lead to unpredictable results due to incompatibility with 2-byte characters). Increases required program storage space, use cautiously. By default Cyrillic typeset is off. Should be called before `GEM_u8g2::init()`.

* **init()**  
  *Returns*: nothing  
  Init the menu: load necessary sprites into RAM of the SparkFun Graphic LCD Serial Backpack (for AltSerialGraphicLCD version), display GEM splash screen, etc.
  > The following `GLCD` object settings will be applied during `init()`: 
  > * `glcd.drawMode(GLCD_MODE_NORMAL)`;
  > * `glcd.fontMode(GLCD_MODE_NORMAL)`;
  > * `glcd.set(GLCD_ID_CRLF, 0)`;

* **reInit()**  
  *Returns*: nothing  
  Set GEM specific settings to their values, set initially in `init()` method. If you were working with AltSerialGraphicLCD, U8g2 or Adafruit GFX graphics in your own user-defined button action, it may be a good idea to call `reInit()` before drawing menu back to screen (generally in custom `context.exit()` routine). See [context](#appcontext) for more details.

### GEMPage

Menu page holds menu items `GEMItem` and represents menu level. Menu can have multiple menu pages (linked to each other) with multiple menu items each. Object of class `GEMPage` defines as follows:

```cpp
GEMPage menuPage(title[, exitAction]);
```

* **title**  
  *Type*: `char*`  
  Title of the menu page displayed at top of the screen.
  
  > **Note:** there is no explicit restriction on the length of the title. However, AltSerialGraphicLCD, U8g2 and Adafruit GFX vesrions handle long titles differently. If title won't fit on a single line, it will overflow to the next line in AltSerialGraphicLCD and Adafruit GFX versions, but will be cropped at the edge of the screen in U8g2 version. In case of AltSerialGraphicLCD and Adafruit GFX versions it is possible to accommodate multiline menu titles by enlarging `menuPageScreenTopOffset` when initializing `GEM` object.

* **exitAction** [*optional*]  
  *Type*: `pointer to function`  
  Pointer to a function that will be executed when `GEM_KEY_CANCEL` key is pressed while being on top level menu page (i.e. page that has no parent menu page) and not in edit mode. Action-specific [context](#appcontext) can be created, which can have its own enter (setup) and exit callbacks as well as loop function.

#### Methods

* **addMenuItem(** _GEMItem&_ menuItem **)**  
  *Accepts*: `GEMItem`  
  *Returns*: nothing  
  Add menu item to menu page. Accepts `GEMItem` object.

* **setParentMenuPage(** _GEMPage&_ parentMenuPage **)**  
  *Accepts*: `GEMPage`  
  *Returns*: nothing  
  Specify parent level menu page (to know where to go back to when pressing Back button, that will be added automatically). Accepts `GEMPage` object.

* **setTitle(** _char*_ title **)**  
  *Returns*: nothing  
  Set title of the menu page. Can be used to update menu page title dynamically.

* *char** **getTitle()**  
  *Returns*: `char*`  
  Get title of the menu page.


----------


### GEMItem

Menu item of the menu. Can represent editable or read-only variable of type `int`, `byte`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`, `char[17]` (or `char[GEM_STR_LEN]`, to be exact); option select of type `int`, `byte`, `float`, `double`, `char[n]`; link to another menu page; or button that can invoke user-defined actions and create action-specific context, which can have its own enter (setup) and exit callbacks as well as loop function. User-defined callback function can be specified to invoke when editable menu item is saved or option is selected. Exact definition of `GEMItem` object depends on its type.

> **Note:** support for editable variables of types `float` and `double` is optional. It is enabled by default, but can be disabled by editing [config.h](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/blob/master/src/config.h) file that ships with the library. Disabling this feature may save considerable amount of program storage space (up to 10% on Arduino UNO). See [Floating-point variables](#floating-point-variables) for more details.

GEMItem menuItemVar(title, linkedVariable[, readonly]);
```
or
```cpp
GEMItem menuItemVar(title, linkedVariable[, saveCallback]);

* **saveCallback** [*optional*]  
  *Type*: `pointer to function`  
  Pointer to callback function executed when associated variable is successfully saved.

> **Note:** you cannot specify both readonly mode and callback in the same constructor. However, you can set readonly mode for menu item with callback explicitly later using `GEMItem::setReadonly()` method.

#### Option select

GEMItem menuItemSelect(title, linkedVariable, select[, readonly]);
```
or
```cpp
GEMItem menuItemSelect(title, linkedVariable, select[, saveCallback]);
```

  Title of the menu item displayed on the screen.

* **linkedVariable**  
  *Type*: `int`, `byte`, `float`, `double`, `char[n]`  
  Reference to variable that menu item is associated with. Note that in case of `char[n]` variable, character array should be big enough to hold select option with the longest value to avoid overflows. It can be greater than `GEM_STR_LEN` limit (i.e. it is possible to have `n` > 17) set for non-select menu item variable.

* **select**  
  *Type*: `GEMSelect`  
  Reference to [`GEMSelect`](#gemselect) option select object that represents a list of available values.

  Sets readonly mode for variable that menu item is associated with.

* **saveCallback** [*optional*]  
  *Type*: `pointer to function`  
  Pointer to callback function executed when associated variable is successfully saved.

> **Note:** you cannot specify both readonly mode and callback in the same constructor. However, you can set readonly mode for menu item with callback explicitly later using `GEMItem::setReadonly()` method.

#### Link to menu page

```cpp
GEMItem menuItemLink(title, linkedPage[, readonly]);
```

* **title**  
  *Type*: `char*`  
  Title of the menu item displayed on the screen.

* **linkedPage**  
  *Type*: `GEMPage`  
  Menu page `GEMPage` that menu item is associated with.

* **readonly** [*optional*]  
  *Type*: `boolean`  
  *Values*: `GEM_READONLY` (alias for `true`), `false`  
  *Default*: `false`  
  Sets readonly mode for the link (user won't be able to navigate to linked page).

#### Button

  *Type*: macro `#define GEM_HIDDEN true`  
  *Value*: `true`  
  Alias for hidden state of the menu item. Submitted as **hide** option to `GEMItem::hide()` method.

  *Type*: macro `#define GEM_STR_LEN 17`  
  *Value*: `17`  
  Alias for supported length of the string (character sequence) variable of type `char[GEM_STR_LEN]`. Note that this limits the length of the string that can be used with editable character menu item variable, but option select variable doesn't have this restriction. But you still have to make sure that in the latter case character array should be big enough to hold select option with the longest value to avoid overflows.

#### Methods

----------


### GEMSelect

List of values available for option select. Supplied to `GEMItem` constructor. Object of class `GEMSelect` defines as follows:

```cpp
GEMSelect mySelect(length, optionsArray);
```

* **length**  
  *Type*: `byte`  
  Length of `optionsArray`. Should be explicitly supplied because array is passed as a pointer. Easy way to provide array length is to calculate it using the following expression: `sizeof(optionsArray)/sizeof(SelectOptionInt)`, or `sizeof(optionsArray)/sizeof(SelectOptionByte)`, or `sizeof(optionsArray)/sizeof(SelectOptionFloat)`, or `sizeof(optionsArray)/sizeof(SelectOptionDouble)`, or `sizeof(optionsArray)/sizeof(SelectOptionChar)` depending on the type of the array used.

* **optionsArray**  
  *Type*: `void*` (pointer to array of type either `SelectOptionInt`, or `SelectOptionByte`, or `SelectOptionFloat`, or `SelectOptionDouble`, or `SelectOptionChar`)  
  Array of the available options. Type of the array is either `SelectOptionInt`, or `SelectOptionByte`, or `SelectOptionFloat`, or `SelectOptionDouble`, or `SelectOptionChar` depending on the kind of data options are selected from. See the following section for definition of these custom types.

Example of use:

```cpp
// Integer option select
// 1) Create array of options:
SelectOptionInt optionsArray[] = {{"Opt 1", 10}, {"Opt 2", -12}, {"Opt 3", 13}};
// 2) Supply array of options to GEMSelect constructor:
GEMSelect mySelect(sizeof(optionsArray)/sizeof(SelectOptionInt), optionsArray);
```
or
```cpp
// Integer option select
// GEMSelect constructor with anonymous options array (length of array (3) can't be calculated in this case and should be explicitly supplied):
GEMSelect mySelect(3, (SelectOptionInt[]){{"Opt 1", 10}, {"Opt 2", -12}, {"Opt 3", 13}});
```


----------


### SelectOptionInt

```

* **name**  
  *Type*: `char*`  
  Text label of the option as displayed in select.

* **val_int**  
  *Type*: `int`  
  Value of the option that is assigned to linked variable upon option selection.

### SelectOptionByte

  *Type*: `char*`  
  Text label of the option as displayed in select.

* **val_byte**  
  *Type*: `byte`  
  Value of the option that is assigned to linked variable upon option selection.

### SelectOptionFloat

Data structure that represents option of the select of type `float`. Object of type `SelectOptionFloat` defines as follows:

```cpp
SelectOptionFloat selectOption = {name, val_float};
```

* **name**  
  *Type*: `char*`  
  Text label of the option as displayed in select.

* **val_float**  
  *Type*: `float`  
  Value of the option that is assigned to linked variable upon option selection.

### SelectOptionDouble

Data structure that represents option of the select of type `double`. Object of type `SelectOptionDouble` defines as follows:

```cpp
SelectOptionDouble selectOption = {name, val_double};
```

* **name**  
  *Type*: `char*`  
  Text label of the option as displayed in select.

* **val_double**  
  *Type*: `double`  
  Value of the option that is assigned to linked variable upon option selection.

### SelectOptionChar

Data structure that represents option of the select of type `char*`. Object of type `SelectOptionChar` defines as follows:

```cpp
SelectOptionChar selectOption = {name, val_char};
```

* **name**  
  *Type*: `char*`  
  Text label of the option as displayed in select.

* **val_char**  
  *Type*: `char*`  
  Value of the option that is assigned to linked variable upon option selection. Note that character array of associated with menu item variable (of type `char[n]`) should be big enough to hold select option with the longest value to avoid overflows.


----------


### AppContext

Data structure that represents "context" of the currently executing user action, toggled by pressing menu item button. Property `context` of the `GEM` (`GEM_u8g2`, `GEM_adafruit_gfx`) object is of type `AppContext`. 

Consists of pointers to user-supplied functions that represent setup and loop functions (named `context.enter()` and `context.loop()` respectively) of the context. It allows you to initialize variables and e.g. prepare screen (if needed for the task that function performs), and then run through loop function, waiting for user input, or sensor reading, or command to terminate and exit back to the menu eventually. In the latter case additional `context.exit()` function will be called, that can be used to clean up your context and e.g. to free some memory and draw menu back to screen.

Object of type `AppContext` defines as follows:

```cpp
AppContext myContext = {loop, enter, exit, allowExit};
```

* **loop**  
  *Type*: `pointer to function`  
  Pointer to `loop()` function of current context. Similar to regular `loop()` function; executed each regular `loop()` iteration. Usually contains code of user-defined action that is run when menu item button is pressed.

* **enter** [*optional*]  
  *Type*: `pointer to function`  
  Pointer to `enter()` function of current context. Similar to regular `setup()` function, called manually, generally once before context's `loop()` function; is optional. Usually contains some additional set up required by the user-defined action pointed to by context's `loop()`.

* **exit** [*optional*]  
  *Type*: `pointer to function`  
  Pointer to `exit()` function of current context. Called automatically when user exits currently running context if `context.allowExit` (see below) is set to `true`. Should be invoked manually otherwise. Usually contains instructions to do some cleanup after context's `loop()` and to draw menu on screen again (by calling `drawMenu()` method of `GEM`, `GEM_u8g2` or `GEM_adafruit_gfx` object). If no user-defined function specified, default action will be invoked that consists of call to three methods of `GEM`, `GEM_u8g2` or `GEM_adafruit_gfx` object: `reInit()`, `drawMenu()`, and `clearContext()`.

* **allowExit**
  *Type*: `boolean`  
  *Default*: `true`  
  Setting to `false` will require manually exit the context's `loop()` from within the loop itself: all necessary key detection should be done in context's `loop()` accordingly, and `context.exit()` should be called explicitly; otherwise exit is handled automatically by pressing `GEM_KEY_CANCEL` key.

Basic example of use:

```cpp
...

void buttonAction(); // Forward declaration
GEMItem menuItemButton("Blink!", buttonAction);

...

// Create menu object
GEM menu(glcd); // AltSerialGraphicLCD version used for example

...

void buttonAction() {
  // Declaration of context functions
  menu.context.loop = buttonContextLoop;
  menu.context.enter = buttonContextEnter; // Optional
  menu.context.exit = buttonContextExit; // Optional
  // Call of context functions
  menu.context.enter();
  //menu.context.allowExit = false; // Set to false if required to manually exit the context loop from within the loop itself (default is true)
}

void buttonContextEnter() {
  // Running some user-defined routines that usually belongs to setup()
  // Clear LCD screen
  glcd.clearScreen();
  // Initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void buttonContextLoop() {
  // Do something in the loop() function you would normally do in the sketch, e.g. blink built in LED
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  delay(500);
}

void buttonContextExit() {
  // Set GEM specific settings to their values
  menu.reInit();
  // Draw menu back to screen
  menu.drawMenu();
  // Clear context (assigns `nullptr` values to function pointers of the `context` property of the `GEM` object and resets `allowExit` flag to its default state)
  menu.clearContext();
}

```

To exit currently running context and return to menu, press button associated with `GEM_KEY_CANCEL` key (only if `context.allowExit` flag is set to its default value of `true`, otherwise you should handle exit from the loop manually and call `context.exit()` explicitly) - `context.exit()` callback will be called.

For more details see supplied example on context usage and read corresponding section of the [wiki](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki).

Floating-point variables
-----------
The [`float`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/float/) data type has only 6-7 decimal digits of precision ("[mantissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation)"). For AVR based Arduino boards (like UNO) [`double`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/double/) data type has basically the same precision, being only 32 bit wide (the same as `float`). On some other boards (like SAMD boards, e.g. with M0 chips) double is actually a 64 bit number, so it has more precision (up to 15 digits).

Internally in GEM, [`dtostrf()`](http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__stdlib.html#ga060c998e77fb5fc0d3168b3ce8771d42) and [`atof()`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/atof/) are used to convert floating-point number to and from a string. Support for `dtostrf()` comes with `stdlib.h` for AVR, and hence available out of the box for AVR-based boards. While it is possible to use [`sprintf()`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/sprintf/) for some other boards (like SAMD), `dtostrf()` is used for them instead as well, for consistency through explicit inclusion of `avr/dtostrf.h`. See [this thread](https://github.com/plotly/arduino-api/issues/38#issuecomment-108987647) for some more details on `dtostrf()` support across different boards.

Default precision (the number of digits **after** the decimal sign, in terms of `dtostrf()`) is set to 6, but can be individually set for each editable menu item using `GEMItem::setPrecision()` method.

Note that maximum length of the number should not exceed `GEM_STR_LEN` (i.e. 17) - otherwise overflows and undetermined behavior may occur (that includes the value of precision specified through `GEMItem::setPrecision()` method or default one, which will increase length of the number with trailing zeros if necessary). This is result of using `char[GEM_STR_LEN]` buffer during `dtostrf()` conversion. It is not possible to enter number with the length exceeding this limit during edit of the variable, however, additional caution should be taken to verify that initial value of the variable (or externally changed value) in combination with specified precision does not exceed this limit.

It is possible to exclude support for editable `float` and `double` variables to save some space on your chip (up to 10% of program storage space on UNO). For that, locate file [config.h](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/blob/master/src/config.h) that comes with the library, open it and comment out corresponding inclusion, i.e. change this line:

```cpp
#include "config/support-float-edit.h"
```

to

```cpp
// #include "config/support-float-edit.h"
```

Note that option selects support `float` and `double` variables regardless of this setting.

Configuration
-----------
It is possible to configure GEM library by excluding some features not needed in your project. That may help to save some additional program storage space. E.g., you can disable support for editable floating-point variables (see previous [section](#floating-point-variables)).

You can also choose which version of GEM library (`AltSerialGraphicLCD`, `U8g2` or `Adafruit GFX` based) should be compiled. That way, there won't be requirement to have all of the supported graphics libraries installed in the system at the same time (regardless of which one is actually used).

For that, locate file [config.h](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/blob/master/src/config.h) that comes with the library, open it and comment out corresponding inclusion.

To disable `AltSerialGraphicLCD` support comment out the following line:

```cpp
#include "config/enable-glcd.h"
```

To disable `U8g2` support comment out the following line:

```cpp
#include "config/enable-u8g2.h"
```

To disable `Adafruit GFX` support comment out the following line:

```cpp
#include "config/enable-adafruit-gfx.h"
```

More configuration options may be be added in the future.

> Keep in mind that contents of the `config.h` file most likely will be reset to its default state after installing library update.

Compatibility
-----------
When support for [Floating-point variables](#floating-point-variables) is enabled, GEM relies on `dtostrf()` function to handle conversion to a string, which may not be available for all of the architectures supported by Arduino by default. You may have to manually include support for it, e.g., via explicit inclusion of suitable version of `dtostrf.h` header file in `GEM.cpp`, `GEM_u8g2.cpp` or `GEM_adafruit_gfx.cpp` source files. It is available for AVR-based boards by default and currently it is explicitly included for SAMD boards (e.g. with M0 chips). ESP32-based boards should be fine as well.

Examples
-----------
GEM library comes with several annotated examples that will help you get familiar with it. More detailed info on the examples (including schematic and breadboard view where necessary) available in [wiki](https://github.com/Spirik/GEM/wiki).
